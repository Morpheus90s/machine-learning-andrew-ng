# Machine Learning - Linear Regression Study

This repository contains my study and implementation of Linear Regression
during my Machine Learning course.

I focused on understanding the mathematical concepts
and implementing the algorithm using Python and NumPy.

# Week 1 - Linear Regression (Single Variable)

In this week I learned the basic concepts of Machine Learning.

Topics covered:

- What is Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Linear Regression Model
- Cost Function
- Gradient Descent

# Week 2 - Multiple Linear Regression

In this week I extended Linear Regression to work with multiple features.

Topics covered:

- Multiple Linear Regression
- Vectorization with NumPy
- Feature Scaling
- Learning Rate tuning
- Polynomial Regression
- Using scikit-learn
