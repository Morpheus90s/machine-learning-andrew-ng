# Notes - Week 1

Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Supervised Learning:
- Uses labeled data
- Example: house price prediction

Unsupervised Learning:
- Uses unlabeled data
- Example: clustering

Linear Regression:
- Model: y = wx + b
- Cost Function: Mean Squared Error
- Optimization method: Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent:
- Update rule:
    w = w - alpha * derivative
- Alpha = learning rate
